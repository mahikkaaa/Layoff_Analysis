# Layoff_Analysis
 Layoffs are becoming more frequent occurrences that stress those who find themselves in the firing line. Many businesses are forced to implement mass layoffs as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is causing revenue losses throughout the world. Employees will surely find this stressful. However, studies have shown that uncertainty about potential job loss can have a range of detrimental psychological, behavioural, and physiological effects that are even worse than being actually laid off. To avoid all of the difficulties that can arise during analysis, one could use a data visualisation to drive conclusions from the layoff trend and make predictions. This data visualisation will help us better understand countries’ and companies’ layoff scenario.
