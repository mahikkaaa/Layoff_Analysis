# Layoff_Analysis
 Layoffs are becoming more frequent occurrences that stress those who find themselves in the firing line. Many businesses are forced to implement mass layoffs as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is causing revenue losses throughout the world. Employees will surely find this stressful. However, studies have shown that uncertainty about potential job loss can have a range of detrimental psychological, behavioural, and physiological effects that are even worse than being actually laid off. To avoid all of the difficulties that can arise during analysis, one could use a data visualisation to drive conclusions from the layoff trend and make predictions. This data visualisation will help us better understand countries’ and companies’ layoff scenario.

Keywords- Data Visualisation, Layoff, Industry, GDP, Country, Impact, Income, Employment, Laid

Implementation: The first step in the methodology followed included data collection. 
I used the Layoffs dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022] from Kaggle. 

The dataset contains 9 columns mentioning the company, location, industry, number of total laid off, percent of total laid off, date, stage of company, the funds raised by each company and the countries they belong to from 2020 to 2022. The dataset was cleaned and pre-processed to remove null values and irrelevant columns.


So we have used pandas framework to clean the data, the various steps involved in cleaning the data are:

1. Removing the null values
2. Removing the irrelevant columns
3. Removing the irrelevant rows
4. Removing the duplicate values
5. Keeping records of the most recent data available

The second step was to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset. We used various visualizations to understand the data and its distribution. We also used various statistical tests to understand the relationship between the variables.
